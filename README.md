## Notes

- h2 margins not responsive (problem on skills. h2) I guess you would use grid/flex for this? might be able to achieve with media queries? didn't want to waste too much time on this.
- proabable should have used more divs :rofl: it is pretty jank.
- or put a border same colour as background aroung portrait. Wouldn't solve radius on heading issue.
